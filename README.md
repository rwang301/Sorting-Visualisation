# Sorting-Visualisation

## Motivation
Sorting algorithms were always something I would read up on the night before an interview and immediately forget after the interview. Not only did I find this ineffective but my understanding of the algorithms would often be exposed when the interviewer dug deeper or asked for pseudocode.

This small project was made to help myself (and others) visualise the difference between the sorting algorithms at different speeds and data sizes.

## Running

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have:
- python3 installed
- node.js and npm installed

### Installing

Clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:rwang301/Sorting-Visualisation.git`

Create a local HTTP server:

`python3 -m http.server`

> By default this will run on port 8000. But if you need to change this, simply append the port number to the command, where XXXX is the port you choose to use:

`python3 -m http.server XXXX`

## Usage

Once you are up and running, the program is very easy to use. Simply fill all the drop downs menus. That is, the type of sort you want to use, the number of elements to sort and the speed at which you want to sort and then click sort.
